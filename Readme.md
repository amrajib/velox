## Introduction

Operating systems are the backbone of modern computing. They manage hardware and software resources and provide services for computer programs. Velox aims to provide a simple yet effective platform to understand the core principles of OS development. By using Rust, we focus on safety and performance, making it an excellent choice for systems programming.

## Features

- **Written in Rust**: Leverage Rust's memory safety and concurrency features.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend and modify components.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple command-line interface for interaction.
- **Learning Resources**: Documentation and tutorials to guide you through the OS development process.
- **Active Community**: Join our discussions and contribute to the project.
